- 👋 Hi, I’m @Supermorose
- 👀 I’m interested in spending time with my soon to be wife, hardcore & metalcore (e.g. Hatebreed, Misery Signals, Undying), collecting vintage items, and archivism.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever the coursework on The Odin Project requires of me. As of December 7sth, 2022, I am about to reach the FlexBox section of the course. The CSS is slightly familiar to me but I'm still having some minor difficulties with the concepts of specificity and the cascade.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever comes my way down the pipeline. I have an idea for an archivism website but I'd have to see if anything similar is already in existence.
- 📫 How to reach me: There's no need for anyone to reach me at this moment so I won't provide anything. At some point I'll make a public Twitter where I don't only tweet about my moronic conversations with friends.
