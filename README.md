- 👋 Hi, I’m @Supermorose
- 👀 I’m interested in spending time with my soon to be wife, hardcore & metalcore (e.g. Hatebreed, Misery Signals, Undying), collecting vintage items, and archivism.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever the coursework on The Odin Project requires of me. As of December 1st, 2022, I am in the Recipes Project section and I don't think there has been anything particularly difficult but I'm sure that's subject to change.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever comes my way down the pipeline. I have an idea for an archivism website but I'd have to see if anything similar is already in existence.
- 📫 How to reach me: There's no need for anyone to reach me at this moment so I won't provide anything. At some point I'll make a public Twitter where I don't only tweet about my moronic conversations with friends.
